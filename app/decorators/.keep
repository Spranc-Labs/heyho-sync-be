# Decorators

Decorators add presentation logic to models without cluttering the model itself.
Use them for view-specific formatting and display concerns.

Example usage:
```ruby
class UserDecorator < BaseDecorator
  def full_name
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}".strip
  end

  def status_badge
    verified? ? 'Verified' : 'Pending'
  end
end
```
